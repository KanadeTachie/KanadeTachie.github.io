									<h2>1. Overall Learnings / Summary of the Topic</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<b>Definition of a Graph</b><br>
										A graph G = (V,E) consists of V, a nonempty set of vertices (or nodes) and E, a set of edges. 
										Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its endpoints. An edge is said to connect its endpoints.
										<br><br><b>Infinite Graph</b><br>
										A graph with infinite vertex set
										<br><br><b>Finite Graph</b><br>
										A graph with finite vertex set

									</div>

									<div class="box">
										<b>Simple graph</b><br>
										A simple graph G = (V,E) consists of V, a nonempty set of vertices, and E, a set of unordered pairs of 
										distinct elements of V called edges.

									</div>

									<div class="box">
										<b>Multigraph</b><br>
										A multigraph G = (V,E) consists of a set E of edges, and a function f from E to {{u,v} | u, v 
										an element of V, u not equal v}. The edges e1 and e2 are called multiple or parallel edges if f(e1) = f(e2). 
									</div>

									<div class="box">
										<b>Pseudograph</b><br>
										A pseudograph G = (V,E) consists of a set V of vertices, a set E of edges, and a function f from E to {{u,v} 
										| u, v an element of V}. An edge is a loop if f(e) = {u,u} = {u} for some u an element of  V

									</div>

									<div class="box">
										<b>Directed graph</b><br>
										A directed graph (V,E) consists of a set of vertices V and a set of edges E that are ordered 
										pairs of elements of V

									</div>
									<div class="box">
										<b>Directed multigraph</b><br>
										A directed multigraph G = (V,E) consists of a set V of vertices, a set E of edges, and a function
										f from E to {{u,v} | u, v an element of V}. The edges e1 and e2 are multiple edges if f(e1) = f(e2).

									<h2>2. Analysis</h2>
									<p>The following topics of Exam 3 are generally about and related to Graph Theory. Graphs and their models deal with the relationships of objects
										and display them as a vertex with lines called edges that symbolize relation to another vertex. Graphs provide a powerful framework for
										representing and analyzing relationships of certain objects in real-life scenarios. 
										For this topic, it describes the very definition of a graph as well as its different kinds and models. A simple graph has only one line 
										or edge to one or more vertices. The multigraph has more than one line or edge directed to a vertex. A pseudograph has an edge directed 
										at its own vertex. There are two types of graphs which are either directed or undirected. Directed illustrates a one-way relationship 
										wherever the arrow is pointed. The pointed vertex cannot have a relationship with the original vertex unless it also points back to it.
										This concept applies to all 3 kinds (Simple, Multiple, Pseudo). The ones described without the word “directed”  above are all undirected
										graphs. Understanding graphs create an easier understanding of whatever the graphs are representing. Graphs create a visual tool for 
										easier understanding of most problems with relationships.

									<h2>3. Applications, Real-Life Scenarios or Examples</h2>
									<p><b>Used in: </b>
									<br> - Internet and Web Networks
									<br> -  Online Social Networks
									<br> - 	Computer Networks
									<br> - 	Image and Video Processing
									<br><br>

									<h3><b>Example Graph models:
									</b></h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/E3-01-02.png" alt="" style="width: 80%"/></a>
									<blockquote><b>Example 3.1.1 :</b> A simple undirected graph of a network. A Token Ring Network graph of a Media Access Unit.
									</blockquote>

									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/E3-01-03.png" alt="" style="width: 90%"/></a>
									<blockquote><b>Example 3.1.2 :</b> A complex directed graph that shows social relationships. In this case, this is an example 
										of the social relationships between Game of Thrones Characters. In this example, from the orange node from the lower left 
										corner, Cressen does not know Ser Davos but Ser Davos knows him.
										<br><br> This is only an assumption from the given graph that this 
										is about who knows who since there is no way Ser Davos would not know who is Melisandr (receiving directed arrow above Davos node) else this graph is incorrect in using directed edges.

									</blockquote>

									<h2>4. Reflection and Thoughts</h2>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										Understanding Graphs and their models is a refresher to the mind from the difficult understanding of Bayes Theorem in the previous 
										topics. Graphing relationships and networks are easy to understand as it visually represents the relationship. Understanding the
										types and kinds of graphs is fundamental in understanding how to find the shortest paths, Euler and Hamiltonian paths, traveling
										salesman, and more. For me, this is probably the easiest topic to analyze and visualize as it uses almost little to no formulas
										at all in finding relationships. After all, graph theory is designed to represent relationships and make a better understanding
										of those difficult relationships easier.
