									<h2>1. Overall Learnings / Summary of the Topic</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<b>From Finite Probability</b><br>
										<b>Experiment</b>
										<br>A procedure that yields one of a given set of possible outcomes.
										<br><br><b>Sample Space</b>
										<br>The set of possible outcomes
										<br><br><b>Event</b> 
										<br>A subset of the sample space. An event is part of all the possible outcomes.

										<br><b>p(E) = | E | / | S |</b>
										<br>Where E is the number of outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes S.
										</div>
									

										
									<div class="box">
										<b><h4>Rules</h4></b>
										Let S be the sample space of an experiment with a finite or countable number of outcomes. We assign a probability p(s) to each outcome s.
										Two conditions must be met:
										<br><b>1. The probability of each outcome is a nonnegative real number no greater than 1.</b>
										<br><b>2. The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes should be 1.</b>
									</div>
									
									<div class="box">
										<b><h4>Definition 1</h4></b>
										<b>Suppose that S is a set with n elements. The uniform distribution assigns the probability 1/n to each element of S.</b> 
									</div>
									<div class="box">
										<b><h4>Definition 2</h4></b>
										<b>The probability of the event E is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in E.</b>
									</div>

									<h2>2. Analysis</h2>
									<p>Probability theory is an extension of the analysis from finite probability. Probability theory describes in detail the rules and definitions 
										of finite probability. It suggests that no probability is greater than 1 or less than 0 (negative probability). The sum of all likelihood of 
										some event will happen is and should always be 1. One cannot say that there is a 1000% percent that something will happen in an event.
										Likewise, one cannot say that something will not happen by a -200%, as if the opposite of that event instead will happen. This topic sets
										the rules and boundaries of what a probability should be and how likely such a probability will happen.

									</p>

									<h2>3. Applications, Real-Life Scenarios or Examples</h2>
									<p><b>Used in: (Same as Finite Probability) </b>
									<br> - Algorithms analysis
									<br> -  Machine learning
									<br> - 	Cryptography
									<br> - 	Network Analysis
									<br> - 	Games and Entertainment
									<br><br>

									<h3><b>Games and Entertainment</b></h3>

									<blockquote><b>Example 2.2.1 - Die :</b> Suppose that a die is biased so that 3 appears twice as often as each other number but 
										that the other five outcomes are equally likely. What is the probability that an odd number appears when we roll this die?

										<br><br><b>Solution: </b><br>
										The probability of rolling a dice number other than 3 is 
										<br>P(n) = x for n is an element of {1,2,3,4,5,6} - {3}
										<br>in which the dice numbers other than 3 are equally likely to appear. 

										<br><br>P(3) = 2x since 3 appears twice as likely to appear than any other number. Thus by condition 2:
										<br>P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) +P(6) = 1
										<br>x + x + 2x + x + x+ x = 1
										<br>7x = 1
										<br>x = 1/7 

										<br><br>That means, p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) = 1/7
										<br>p(3) = 2/7

										<br><br>Therefore p(E) = p(1) + p(3) + p(5) = 1/7 + 2/7 +1/7 = <b>4/7</b>

									<blockquote><b>Example 2.2.2 - Coin Toss: </b> What probabilities should we assign to the outcomes H (heads) and T (tails) when a fair coin is
										 flipped? What probabilities should be assigned to these outcomes when the coin is biased so that heads comes up twice as often as tails?

										<br><br><b>Solution: </b><br>
										Taken from the assumption that heads will come up twice as often as tails
										<br><b>p(H) = 2p(T) </b>
										<br>From the second condition that all probabilities of a sample space are equal to 1
										<br><b>p(H) + p(T) = 1</b>
										<br><br>Substitute:
										<br>2p(T) + p(T) = 1
										<br>3p(T) = 1
										<br><b>p(T) 1/3 </b>
										<br>
										<b>We can conclude that p(T) = 1/3 and p(H) = 2/3. This means that the tails' chances of appearing are 1/3 while for the heads chances are 2/3.
										</b>

									<h2>4. Reflection and Thoughts</h2>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The topic of Probability theory extends the concepts of rules and definitions from finite probability. 
										The addition of 2 new definitions and probability conditions made problems more complex but also made 
										them easier to be broken down into solvable solutions. Just like how current topics solidify the previous
										related one, these new concepts solidified my understanding of Finite Probability. It gave clear rules
										as to what a probability must be and how it must be defined. Despite challenges, I managed to understand
										the gist of it. Speaking from the past self where I did not yet fully understand the rules given in 
										Probability theory, Bayes theorem applies all of the previous topics not just in exam 2 which makes 
										the next topic the hardest one to understand for me so far.
