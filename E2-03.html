									<h2>1. Overall Learnings / Summary of the Topic</h2>
									<div class="box">
										Suppose we know p(F), the probability that an event F occurs, but we have knowledge that an event E occurs.
										Then the conditional probability that F occurs given that E occurs, p(F | E), is a more realistic estimate
										than p(F) that occurs. We can find p(F | E) when we know p(F), p(E | F), and P(E|F bar).<br>

									<h2>2. Analysis</h2>
									<p>Bayes theorem basically describes the probability of an event happening, based on some prior knowledge of related conditions to the event.
										Like how the opposite side on an inner angle in a triangle affects the hypothenuse and adjacent sides, Bayes's theorem relates one event's
										possibility of an event to occur to another event’s likelihood of happening. This theorem is an extension of Finite probability and its
										theories as it applies most concepts to this theorem. This theorem simply indirectly finds the probability of an event to another, 
										assuming that those two such events are under one related experiment or sample space.

									<h2>3. Applications, Real-Life Scenarios or Examples</h2>
									<p><b>Used in (Once again similar to finite probability as it is merely an extension of it): </b>
									<br> - Algorithms analysis
									<br> -  Machine learning
									<br> - 	Cryptography
									<br> - 	Network Analysis
									<br> - 	Games and Entertainment
									<br><br>

									<h3><b>Example</b></h3>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/E2-03-04.png" alt="" style="width: 80%"/></a>
									<blockquote><b>Example 2.3.1 - Flu Cases :</b> Suppose that one person in 100,000 has a particular rare disease for which there is a fairly
										 accurate diagnostic test. This test is correct 99% of the time when given to someone with the disease; it is correct 99.5% of the time 
										 when given to someone who does not have the disease. Given this information can we find:

										<br><br><b>(a) The probability that someone who tests positive for the disease has the disease?</b>
										<br><br><b>Solution: </b><br>

										Let F be the event that a person has the disease, and let E be the event that this person tests positive for the disease. Then,
										<br>P (not E | not F) = 0.995;
										<br>Since P(E | F) = 0.99, then P (E | F) = 1-0.99 = 0.01
										<br>Also, P(F) = 1/100,000 or 0.00001, so P(not F) = 1 - 0.00001 = 0.99999
										<br>Now, we can solve for P (F | E) using Bayes’ theorem:
										
										<br><a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/E2-03-05.png" alt="" style="width: 60%"/></a>
										<br><b>This means that only 0.2% of people who test positive for the disease actually have the disease.</b>
										
										<hr>
										<b>(b) The probability that someone who tests negative for the disease does not have the disease?</b>
										<br><br><b>Solution: </b><br>
										<br>Let F be the event that a person has the disease, and let E be the event that this person tests positive for the disease. Then,
										<br>P (not E | not F) = 0.995;
										<br>Since P(E | F) = 0.99, then P (E | F) = 1-0.99 = 0.01
										<br>Also, P(F) = 1/100,000 or 0.00001, so P(not F) = 1 - 0.00001 = 0.99999
										<br>Now, we can solve for P (F | E) using Bayes’ theorem:
										<br><a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/E2-03-06.png" alt="" style="width: 60%"/></a>
										<br><b>Consequently, 99.99% of the people who negative really do not have the disease.</b>

									<h2>4. Reflection and Thoughts</h2>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										Bayes Theorem is the most difficult and challenging part of Finite Probability and its’ theorems. It is the most important,
										and a fundamental part of Machine learning and Neural Networks, the two out of many topics of which that piqued my interest
										in taking a Computer Science course. Despite being already analyzed by computer scientists and ready to be applied in 
										programming using simply a library for Naive Bayes, understanding how it works is crucial in understanding how machine
										learning works. The sudden surge of A.I. technologies that already mimic fictional characters as well as creating unique
										artworks that are almost far better than any artist interested me in learning this theorem. I have tried to understand
										this theorem many times but I am still at that part where I am not confident whether I have truly understood it.
										Even with difficulty, it still will not hinder my attempt of trying to understand its application in A.I. I hope
										there was more time for me to learn this topic as I have goals of trying to create a simple A.I. as a thesis.
